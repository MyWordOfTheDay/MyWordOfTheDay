# My Word Of The Day

## What is it?

Ever come across words that you have to look up the definition for, only to see it again a week later and realise you've already forgotten what it means?

Yeah, me too.

This is a service which takes words you would like to learn, and aims to sends you one at random every day in the hope the definition will stick.

What you do with the words after that is completely up to you, but I recommend trying to use the word you're sent throughout the day to really learn it.

## What's on the roadmap?

* Integration with a Dictionary API, so you can specify the word you want to keep and you'll be able to keep the definition to keep.
  * With the option of specifying a custom definition if the provided ones are unsatisfactory
* Email integration (with SMTP details provided) so you get a daily email
